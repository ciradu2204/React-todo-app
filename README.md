# A To-do app developed using React JS

In this app, you can add, delete, submit and edit items. To edit items,
simply click the edit icon. Once you are done, press the enter key 
to resubmit. This app will persist your data in the browser local 
storage. So whether you reload, close your app or reopened it,
you still have access to your to-dos items.
